$text="We've been hard at work on the CB Dealer ClickBank Storefront since ClickBank updated their data schema. You can now get more out of your storefront.

The entire catalog database is now updated daily. So your product listings are always fresh and up-to-date.

Now you can customize the look of your store. Select from 15 different styles, add your own store name, and even put a tagline in the header.

We are building a statistics module to help you track traffic through your store. Currently, you can view the number of clickthroughs your store generates. We are working to expand and refine the information available to you.

Coming soon: Marketing tools and a Google Adsense plugin to help you maximize your store's exposure and income.

Your store is located at http://www.cbdeals.com/$site/ .

After replying to this email, you will be able to log in to the administration tool for your store by going to http://www.cbdealer.com.

Your login name is the same as your ClickBank affiliate nickname. Please reply to this email to receive a temporary password. You will be able to change your password when you log in. Once again, for security reasons, we ask that you simply send a blank reply to this email so that we can confirm the address we have on file for you. At that time we will send your temporary password.
